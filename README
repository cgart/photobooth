Photobooth project based on Kivy and GPhoto

Requirements:
 - Kivy 1.9.1 (found in externals)
 - numpy >= 1.7
 - Imagemagick (required for convert system command)
 - libgphoto2

Prerequisities:

Per default gphoto installs additional hook ups to the gvfs (gnome virtual
file system). This is of course super usefull when accessing the camera from
a desktop environment, but less when we want to run scripts controlling the
camera. Hence it is recommended to disable gphoto2's gvfs backend with:

sudo rm /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.gtk.Private.GPhoto2VolumeMonitor.service
sudo rm /usr/share/gvfs/mounts/gphoto2.mount
sudo rm /usr/share/gvfs/remote-volume-monitors/gphoto2.monitor
sudo rm /usr/lib/gvfs/gvfs-gphoto2-volume-monitor

ATTENTION: If you would ever need to access the camera using gvfs, you would
need to reenable the hooks.
